How to build it:
```
git clone https://github.com/Dark1510/zpaqfranz-Command-generator.git
cd zpaqfranz-Command-generator
gcc zpaqfranz_command_genV0.5.c -O2 -march=native -o zpaqfranz_command_gen
```
How to use it:

```
./zpaqfranz_command_gen
```

Not much else to say about it, its a simple CLI tool to quickly make yourself a zpaqfranz command to use
with all the options you chose and needed.

Its unlikely that i'll make a GUI version of this, bcs why would i? 
this doesn't do any compression, it just makes a singular command, and leaves you the fuck alone.
